    "# Function renaming\n",
    "\n",
    "This Graph ML task aims at renaming functions in compiled programs, a task that will help the reverse engineering process performed in malware analysis. This work is partially derived from a paper (code2vec) that aims at renaming functions from source code. The current approach will consist on performing graph classification on compiled code function to assign them generic function names that could inform about the purpose of the function.\n",
    "This task is already performed with the help of function signatures, which consist of hash functions (or deep hash functions) of method within libc or any other well known programing library or DLL. However, detection of function signatures is easy to defeat with some degree of polymorphism. In the current approach, we aim at detection functions that that have the same purpose, even thought their code is organized differently"
