Essai projects:
		overview
			main applications
				PROJECT 1: Log analytics
					- SOC(SSH log, dns+webserver, etc...)
					- Malw dynamic executable behaviour (Cuckoo logs)
				PROJECT 2: code analysis
				 	- pattern matching in source code, assembly
				 	- predefined and interesting patterns: obfuscation, bugs, etc..

			main families of techniques
				graph algorithms
				association rules, 
				sequential patter mining,
				time series
				classification
				outlier detection (mainly as classification)
				process mining
				graph mining

			main subgoals
				frequent patterns (baselining)
				outlier detection
				pattern matching / plagiarism / obfuscated 

		strategy
			- someone to publish with?
				- project/company to test
					- maltiverse
					- MISP
					- Cuckoo
				- professor to publish
			- credits for SIRI

		background
			gather books, papers (logs, code)
			read/search
				techniques used
				specific goals for each technique
				successfullness
					technique used?
					real dataset?real world application
