Imagination about GNN on code property graphs


Goal: from one code prop. graph -> output a code prop. graph with only the desired nodes and relations

	ex: given a full code prop. graph
		output a small graph of inputs -> computing nodes -> outputs
		like if no in/out memory manipulations where needed
		capturing long range interactions (like in taint analysis)

1)
original
code
	-> GNN1
	 extracts inputs and outputs relationships
	 and nodes of code that transform them

2) original code graph
	+
   in-out graph

   	-> GNN2.1


   	-> GNN2.2
