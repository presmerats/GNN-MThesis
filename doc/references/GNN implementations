REpresentation Learning on Graphs: Methods and Applications
	Hamilton 2018
	reviews representatio nlearning on graphs (matrix factor, random walk and graph neural neworks ) -> encode graph structure into low-dimensional embeddings.


node embeddings:
	
x	shallow embeddings
		GF, DeepWalk, node2vec,...

x	DNGR & SDNE
		Autoencoder to extract node embedding


aggregation node embeddings

|/	GCN
		Kipf 2017
	
|/	column networks
	
|/	GraphSAGE
		graph sampling and aggregation

|/  Gated GNN
		neighborhood aggr + RNNs
		-allows to aggregate 20 hops neighborhood
		-useful for complex networks like: logical formulas or programs


embedding structural roles

	node2vec

	struc2vec

	GraphWave


subgraph embeddings
	ideas
		sum/avg node embveddings
		introduce a virtual node

	GNN
		diffusion mechanism "message passing"

|/	MPNN

|/	GAT
		Graph Attention Networks


edge embeddings

How to test:

- locally
- Google Colab notebook <- free and easy to share
- Google Cloud Platform 

- github repo with everything
- invite wy
- codes (and notebooks but those are mainly in collab)
- collab notebooks


- GCN keras
	- read train.py
	- see size of cora graph
	- prepare another graph (python igraph)
	- input this graph
