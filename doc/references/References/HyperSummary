intro
-------

graph tasks
	link prediction
	node classification
	-> non Euclidean information

traditional
	summary graph statistics
	kernel funcs
	enginereeed features
	->non adaptable, time consuming


modern: learn graph structure in low-dimensional embeddings
	learn mapping that embeds nodes or sub-graphs as points in a low.dim vddector space
	optimize the mapping so that geometrical relantionshÃ¬ps  in the embedding space reflect  the structure of the original graph

	-matrix factorization
	-random walk
	-graph neural network

	->not hand-engineered preprocessing step, but ml task itself that learns the embedding that encode graph structure
	->learnt embeddings from data
		 A adjacency matrix
		 X node features matrix
	-> use embeddings in other mltask

->unsupervised learning to optimize this mapping
->other methods use supervised learning

Embedding nodes
---------------

goal
	-encode nodes on a low-dimensional vectors
	-summarizing their graph position and the structure of their local graph neighborhood

-> encoding or projecting into a latent space
	where geometric relations in this laten space correspond to interactions in the original graph (e.g. edges)
-> encode nodes on a low-dimensional space summarizing their graph position and the structure of their local graph noieghborhood

encoder-decoder
	encode -> low-dim -> decoder -> recover intersting original features
		similarity measures
		loss func
		training enc-dec
		testin just enc -> downstream ml

###  2.2 shallow embedding (unsupervised)
	matrix Factorization based methods
		Laplacian eigenmaps, inner-product methods (GF, GraRep, Hope)
	random walk based methods
		DeepWalk, node2vec

### 2.3 encoder-decoder architecture (unsupervised)
	node's local neighborhood based
		DNGR, SDNE
	node's local neighbordhood aggregation and convolutional encoder based
		GCN, Column networks, GraphSAGE

### 2.4 supervised...

### 2.6 Embedding structural roles
	struct2vec,
	GraphWave


Applications
	visualization grpahs in 2d: data mining, social sciences, biologu
							   community and hidden-structure discovery

	Clustering and community detection
		comp. biology (related drugs)
		marketing (related products)

	Node classigication
		sem-supervised leagining , labels only on a small subset
		protein classification
		document classiication

	Link prediction
		recommender systems
		comput bio
		statistical rela learning


Embedding Subgraphs
------------------------

goal: 
	encode a set of nodes and edges into a low-dimensional vector embedding.
	
	learn a continuous vector repr. zs in Rd, of an induced subgraph G[S] of the full graph G, 
	S included in V
	
	can also embed entire graph


node embedding and convolutional approaches
	sum-based approaches
	Loopy belief propagtaion
	graph-coarsening approaches
	other: fuzzy histograms, edge embedding layers, 

graph neural networks
	subgraph level task but can be used for node-leve (add a super node)

	GNN: Message passing instead of aggregation from neighbors
		iterative convergence in forward and backward pass
	Gated GNN: removes convergence needs, adds recurrent units
	MPNN: Message Passing Neural Network

Applications
	- subgraph classification
		ex: classify properties of graphs of diff molecules
		ex:  classification images after converted to graph representation
		ex: program properties satisfaction
		ex: logic reasoning tasks
