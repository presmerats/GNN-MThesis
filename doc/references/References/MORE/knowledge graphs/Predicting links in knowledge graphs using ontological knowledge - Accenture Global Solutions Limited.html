            A device receives training data and an ontology for the training data, where the training data includes information associated with a subject of the ontology. The device generates a knowledge graph based on the training data and the ontology, and converts the knowledge graph into knowledge graph embeddings, where the knowledge graph embeddings include points in a k-dimensional metric space. The device receives a new entity that is not present in the knowledge graph embeddings, and generates a new embedding of the new entity. The device adds the new embedding to the knowledge graph embeddings, and utilizes the knowledge graph embeddings, with the new embedding, to perform an action.         </div>

            <!--?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?--><h1>BACKGROUND</h1><p>A knowledge graph or an ontology includes types, properties, and interrelationships between entities that exist in a domain of discourse. A knowledge graph compartmentalizes variables needed for some set of computations, and establishes relationships between the variables. The fields of artificial intelligence, systems engineering, software engineering, biomedical informatics, library science, enterprise bookmarking, and/the likes create knowledge graphs or ontologies to limit complexity and organize information. A knowledge density of a knowledge graph is an average number of attributes and binary relations issued from a given entity, and is measured in facts per entity.</p><h1>SUMMARY</h1><p>According to some implementations, a device may include one or more memories, and one or more processors, communicatively coupled to the one or more memories, to receive training data and an ontology for the training data, where the training data may include information associated with a subject of the ontology. The one or more processors may generate a knowledge graph based on the training data and the ontology, and may convert the knowledge graph into knowledge graph embeddings, where the knowledge graph embeddings may include points in a k-dimensional metric space. The one or more processors may receive a new entity that is not present in the knowledge graph embeddings, and may generate a new embedding of the new entity. The one or more processors may add the new embedding to the knowledge graph embeddings, and may utilize the knowledge graph embeddings, with the new embedding, to perform an action.</p><p>According to some implementations, a non-transitory computer-readable medium may store instructions that include one or more instructions that, when executed by one or more processors, cause the one or more processors to receive a knowledge graph that is generated based on training data and an ontology for the training data, where the training data may include information associated with a subject of the ontology, and the ontology may include classes and properties.

The same reference numbers in different drawings may identify the same or similar elements.</p><p>A knowledge graph is an expressive, schema-rich, domain-independent data modeling paradigm that is particularly well-suited to model relations between entities. In machine learning, knowledge graph embedding models predict existences of labeled links between entities. Such predictions are a result of operations between points (e.g., known as embeddings) in a metric space. The embeddings are learned from the entire knowledge graph during training of the knowledge graph. However, a knowledge graph embedding model is unable to predict links associated with a new unknown entity. In such cases, an embedding model of the knowledge graph cannot predict the links because the unknown entity is not known during the training of the knowledge graph, and the embedding model did not learn a corresponding representation in the metric space. Some techniques handle unknown entities by completely retraining the knowledge graph. Unfortunately, such techniques consume significant time and resources (e.g., processors, memory, and/or the like) in order to retrain the knowledge graph.</p><p>Some implementations described herein provide a prediction platform that predicts links in knowledge graphs using ontological knowledge and without retraining the knowledge graphs. For example, the prediction platform may receive training data and an ontology for the training data, and may generate a knowledge graph based on the training data and the ontology. The prediction platform may convert the knowledge graph into knowledge graph embeddings, and may receive new statements (e.g., that include new entities) that are not present in the training data and among the knowledge graph embeddings. The prediction platform may generate approximate embeddings for each new entity, and may generate revised knowledge graph embeddings that include the new statements. The prediction platform may receive a query for information associated with the knowledge graph, and may generate candidate responses to the query based on the knowledge graph. The prediction platform may score the candidate responses based on the revised knowledge graph embeddings, and may identify a particular candidate response, that best answers the query, based on scoring the candidate responses.</p><p>FIGS. 1A-1G are diagrams of an overview of an example implementation <b>100</b> described herein. As shown in FIG. 1A, a user device may be associated with a prediction platform. As shown in FIG. 1A, and by reference number <b>105</b>, a user of the user device (e.g., via a user interface provided to the user) may cause the user device to provide, to the prediction platform, training data for training a knowledge graph associated with a particular disease (e.g., severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)). As further shown in FIG. 1A, and by reference number <b>110</b>, the user may cause the user device to provide, to the prediction platform, an ontology for the training data. In some implementations, the training data and the ontology may not be stored in the user device, but the user device may cause the training data and the ontology to be provided from a resource, storing the training data and the ontology, to the prediction platform. In some implementations, the training data and the ontology may be stored in the prediction platform. In some implementations, although FIGS. 1A-1G relate to healthcare and biomedical domains, the prediction platform may be used with any type of domain and may be domain agnostic.</p><p>In some implementations, the training data may include information associated with a subject of the ontology. For example, example implementation <b>100</b> relates to an ontology associated with the SARS disease. Thus, the training data may include data associated with the SARS disease that is received from relationship database management systems (RDBMS), comma-separated values (CSV) data stores, and/or the like. As shown in FIG. 1A, the training data may include data indicating a disease (e.g., SARS), a cause of the disease (e.g., virus_XYZ), what organ the disease affects (e.g., lungs), symptoms of the disease (e.g., high fever), a virus identifier (e.g., virus_XYZ), a protein sequence associated with the virus (e.g., ACARBAC), a drug identifier associated with a drug that treats the disease (e.g., SARS vaccine), a drug type (e.g., vaccine), what the drug treats (e.g., SARS), and/or the like.</p><p>The ontology (e.g., resource description framework (RDF) ontology, web ontology language (OWL), and/or the like) for the training data may include classes, types, properties, and interrelationships (e.g., relations) between data of the training data. For example, as shown in FIG. 1A, the ontology may include nodes that represent concepts related to a disease, and edges or links that show interrelationships (e.g., relations) between the concepts related to the disease. As shown, a disease node may connect to a symptom node, and a link between the nodes may indicate that the disease has symptoms. The disease node may connect to a treatment node, and a link between the nodes may indicate that the disease has a treatment. The disease node may connect to a virus node, and a link between the nodes may indicate that the disease is caused by the virus. The disease node may also connect to an organ node, and a link between the nodes may indicate that the disease affects the organ. The virus node may connect to a protein sequence node, and a link between the nodes may indicate that the protein sequence is part of the virus. The organ node may connect to a body node, and a link between the nodes may indicate that the organ is part of the body. The treatment node may connect to a drug node and a vaccine node, and the links between the nodes may indicate that the drug and the vaccine are treatments for the disease.</p><p>As shown in FIG. 1B, and by reference numbers <b>105</b> and <b>110</b>, the training data and the ontology may be provided to a knowledge graph converter of the prediction platform. In some implementations, the knowledge graph converter may receive the training data and the ontology, and may convert the training data from a format received by the prediction platform (e.g., a relational database format, a CSV format, and/or the like) into another format (e.g., a resource descriptive framework (RDF) format). In some implementations, the knowledge graph converter may aggregate the converted training data so that the knowledge graph converter may process the aggregated data.</p><p>As further shown in FIG. 1B, and by reference number <b>115</b>, the knowledge graph converter may generate a knowledge graph based on the training data and the ontology (e.g., based on the converted and aggregated training data and the ontology). In some implementations, the knowledge graph converter may utilize a schema matching technique to align the training data and to integrate the aligned training data into the ontology (e.g., to generate the knowledge graph). The schema matching technique may include determining semantic correspondences between elements of two schemas (e.g., the training data and the ontology). In some implementations, the schema matching technique may analyze and compare the schema to determine correspondences among concepts and to detect possible conflicts. Once the conflicts are detected, the schema matching technique may resolve the conflicts so that merging of the schemas is possible. Once the conflicts are resolved, the schema matching technique may merge the schemas. In some implementations, the schema matching technique may include a schema-level matching technique (e.g., that considers schema information and not instance data), an instance-level matching technique (e.g., that use instance-level data to gather insights into contents and meanings of schema elements), a hybrid matching technique (e.g., that combines several matching techniques to determine match candidates based on multiple criteria or information sources), a reusing matching information technique (e.g., that reuses previous matching information as auxiliary information for future matching tasks), and/or the like.</p><p>In some implementations, the knowledge graph converter may utilize other techniques to align the training data and to integrate the aligned training data into the ontology (e.g., to generate the knowledge graph), such as machine learning techniques, and/or the like.</p><p>As further shown in FIG. 1B, and by reference number <b>120</b>, the knowledge graph may include the training data integrated within the ontology as nodes that represent concepts, and edges or links that show interrelationships (e.g., relations) between the concepts. For example, in addition to the information conveyed by the ontology, the knowledge graph may indicate that SARS is an instance of Disease, that ACARBAC is an instance of a protein sequence, that virus_XYZ node is an instance of a Virus, that lungs are an instance of an Organ, and that SARS vaccine is an instance of Vaccine. Thus, the knowledge graph may indicate that SARS is a disease with a vaccine treatment by the SARS vaccine.</p><p>As shown in FIG. 1C, and by reference number <b>120</b>, a fit/train engine, of the prediction platform, may receive the knowledge graph. In some implementations, the knowledge graph may be serialized into a list of statements, and the list of statements may be received by the fit/train engine. As further shown in FIG. 1C, and by reference number <b>125</b>, the fit/train engine may generate knowledge graph embeddings based on the knowledge graph. In some implementations, the knowledge graph embeddings may include points in a k-dimensional metric space, and may provide latent semantic representations for structured knowledge in the knowledge graph. In some implementations, the knowledge graph embeddings may enable direct explicit relational inferences among entities via simple calculation of embedding vectors, and may be effective at highlighting key concepts underlying sophisticated human language.</p><p>In some implementations, the fit/train engine may convert entities (e.g., nodes) and relations (e.g., links or edges) of the knowledge graph into points in a k-dimensional metric space. For example, as shown in FIG. 1C, and by reference number <b>130</b>, the knowledge graph embeddings may include points in a k-dimensional metric space (e.g., shown as a graph in two dimensions for simplicity). In some implementations, the fit/train engine may minimize a loss function to learn model parameters that best discriminate positive statements from negative statements. In such implementations, the loss function may include a function that maps a statement onto a real number that represents the likelihood of that statement to be true. In such implementations, the loss function may include a pairwise margin-based loss function, a negative log-likelihood loss function, and/or the like. In some implementations, the fit/train engine may assign scores to statements of the knowledge graph in order to aid the loss function in determining how well the knowledge graph tells positive statements from negative statements. In some implementations, the fit/train engine may minimize the loss function in order to determine optimal parameters of the knowledge graph (e.g., the knowledge graph embeddings).</p><p>As further shown in FIG. 1C, and by reference number <b>135</b>, an example knowledge graph in two dimensions (e.g., k=2) may indicate that a SARS vaccine is a treatment for SARS. In such an example, the fit/train engine may generate three knowledge graph embeddings (e.g., points) on a two-dimensional metric space. As further shown, the three points may include a point representing SARS (e.g., located at {1.15, 3.45}), a point representing that SARS has a treatment (e.g., located at {3.25, 1.15}), and a point representing the SARS vaccine (e.g., located at {4.82, 5.62}).</p><p>As shown in FIG. 1D, and by reference number <b>140</b>, assume that the prediction platform receives (e.g., from the user device) new statements, indicating among all that SARS Type B is a disease. As further shown, such input may include ontology-related statements. In some implementations, the ontology may include a SARS Type B node that connects to a disease node, and a link between the nodes may indicate that SARS Type B is a disease. The SARS Type B node may connect to a virus_XYZ node, and a link between the nodes may indicate that SARS Type B is caused by virus_XYZ. The SARS Type B node may connect to a high fever node, and a link between the nodes may indicate that SARS Type B has a high fever as a symptom. The SARS Type B node may connect to a lungs node, and a link between the nodes may indicate that SARS Type B affects the lungs. In some implementations, a serialized representation of the ontology-related statements may indicate the same information in a different format.</p><p>Previously, such new statements were unable to be scored because at least one unseen entity was not included in the training data, the original knowledge graph, and the knowledge graph embeddings, i.e., SARS Type B. However, as further shown in FIG. 1D, and by reference number <b>145</b>, an embedding approximation engine, of the prediction platform, may receive the new unseen entity, and may generate knowledge graph embeddings revised with the embedding of the unseen entity.</p><p>In some implementations, the embedding approximation engine may approximate an embedding for the new entity based on a weight (e.g., &gt;1), the average of the embeddings of the entities that belong to the schema (e.g., the ontology), and are related to the new entity (e.g., the entity “disease” shown in bold and italics in FIG. 1D), and the average of the embeddings of entities that are in the ontology, are related to the new entity but that do not belong to the schema, (e.g., the remaining entities that belong to the statements shown in FIG. 1D, other than the entity “disease”).</p><p>In some implementations, the embedding approximation engine may approximate an embedding for the new entity (e<sub>new </sub>or e<sub>sARs</sub><sub>_</sub><sub>TypeB</sub><sub>_</sub><sub>is</sub><sub>_</sub><sub>a</sub><sub>_</sub><sub>disease</sub>) based on the following equation:</p><p><maths id="MATH-US-00001" num="00001"><math overflow="scroll"><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>e</mi><mi>new</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><mrow><mrow><mi>α</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mrow><mo></mo><msub><mi>η</mi><mi>s</mi></msub><mo></mo></mrow></mfrac><mo>⁢</mo><mrow><munderover><mo>∑</mo><mi>s</mi><mrow><mo></mo><msub><mi>η</mi><mi>s</mi></msub><mo></mo></mrow></munderover><mo>⁢</mo><msub><mi>e</mi><mi>s</mi></msub></mrow></mrow><mo>+</mo><mrow><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mrow><mo></mo><msub><mi>η</mi><mi>e</mi></msub><mo></mo></mrow></mfrac><mo>⁢</mo><mrow><munderover><mo>∑</mo><mi>i</mi><mrow><mo></mo><msub><mi>η</mi><mi>e</mi></msub><mo></mo></mrow></munderover><mo>⁢</mo><msub><mi>e</mi><mi>i</mi></msub></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math></maths> <br> where α may correspond to the weight (e.g., &gt;1), </p><p><maths id="MATH-US-00002" num="00002"><math overflow="scroll"><mrow><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mrow><mo></mo><msub><mi>η</mi><mi>s</mi></msub><mo></mo></mrow></mfrac><mo>⁢</mo><mrow><munderover><mo>∑</mo><mi>s</mi><mrow><mo></mo><msub><mi>η</mi><mi>s</mi></msub><mo></mo></mrow></munderover><mo>⁢</mo><msub><mi>e</mi><mi>s</mi></msub></mrow></mrow></math></maths> <br> may correspond to the average of the entity embeddings that are related to the new entity, and are related to the schema, </p><p><maths id="MATH-US-00003" num="00003"><math overflow="scroll"><mrow><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mrow><mo></mo><msub><mi>η</mi><mi>e</mi></msub><mo></mo></mrow></mfrac><mo>⁢</mo><mrow><munderover><mo>∑</mo><mi>i</mi><mrow><mo></mo><msub><mi>η</mi><mi>e</mi></msub><mo></mo></mrow></munderover><mo>⁢</mo><msub><mi>e</mi><mi>i</mi></msub></mrow></mrow></math></maths> <br> may correspond to the average of the entity embeddings that are related to the new, unseen entity, and are not related to the schema, η<sub>s </sub>may correspond to the entities that are related to the new, unseen entity, and are related to the schema, η<sub>e </sub>may correspond to all other entities that are related to the new entity, and are not related to the schema, e<sub>s </sub>may correspond to an embedding of an entity in the schema, and e<sub>i </sub>may correspond to an embedding of an entity not in the schema. Thus, the embedding approximation engine may apply more weight to the entities that are related to the schema than to the entities that are not related to the schema. </p><p>As further shown in FIG. 1D, and by reference number <b>150</b>, the revised knowledge graph embeddings may include points in the k-dimensional metric space (e.g., shown as a graph in two dimensions for simplicity), and may include points (e.g., embeddings) calculated for the new entity (e.g., e<sub>SARS</sub><sub>_</sub><sub>TypeB</sub>) and for the disease node (e.g., e<sub>disease</sub>).</p><p>With reference to FIG. 1E, in some implementations, the prediction platform may expand a number of schema-related entities utilized by the embedding approximation engine, by utilizing reasoning techniques (e.g., techniques that generate conclusions from available knowledge using logical techniques such as deduction and induction) to infer a new entity (e.g., SARS Type B is a contagious disease). In such implementations, the prediction platform may modify η<sub>s </sub>(e.g., which may correspond to the entities that are in the ontology) based on the following equation:</p><p><maths id="MATH-US-00004" num="00004"><math overflow="scroll"><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>η</mi><mi>s</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><mrow><msubsup><mi>η</mi><mi>s</mi><mi>original</mi></msubsup><mo>+</mo><msubsup><mi>η</mi><mi>s</mi><mi>inferred</mi></msubsup></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math></maths> <br> where η<sub>s</sub><sup>original </sup>may correspond to η<sub>s </sub>described above in connection with FIG. 1D (e.g., which may correspond to the entities that are in the ontology), η<sub>s</sub><sup>inferred </sup>may correspond to the inferred entities (i.e., entities that belong to inferred new statements), and η<sub>s </sub>may correspond to the expanded set of entities related to the new, unseen entity. </p><p>As further shown in FIG. 1E, and by reference number <b>155</b>, the prediction platform may provide, to the embedding approximation engine, the new statements indicating, among all, that SARS Type B is a contagious disease. As further shown, the new entity may include an ontology and a serialized representation of the ontology. In some implementations, the ontology may include the ontology described above in connection with FIG. 1D. The SARS Type B node may also be part of a new inferred statement (e.g., SARS Type B is a contagious disease). In some implementations, the serialized representation of the ontology may indicate the same information as the ontology in a different format, but may also include the statement “SARS Type B is a contagious disease.” The statements “SARS Type B is a disease” and “SARS Type B is a contagious disease” are shown in bold and italics in FIG. 1E to indicate that these statements are related to the schema, while remaining statements are not related to the schema.</p><p>As further shown in FIG. 1E, and by reference number <b>160</b>, an embedding approximation engine, of the prediction platform, may receive the new statements, and may generate revised knowledge graph embeddings for the unseen entity included in the new statements, in the manner described above in connection with FIG. 1D. As further shown in FIG. 1E, and by reference number <b>165</b>, the revised knowledge graph embeddings may include points in the k-dimensional metric space (e.g., shown as a graph in two dimensions for simplicity), and may include a point (e.g., an embedding) calculated for the new, unseen entity (e.g., e<sub>contagious</sub><sub>_</sub><sub>disease</sub>).</p><p>As shown in FIG. 1F, and by reference number <b>170</b>, a candidate generation engine, of the prediction platform, may receive a query to identify a drug that has an effect on SARS Type B. In some implementations, the candidate generation engine may analyze the query based on the knowledge graph to determine drugs that have an effect on SARS. As further shown in FIG. 1F, and by reference number <b>175</b>, the candidate generation engine may generate information indicating candidate drugs based on the query and based on the analysis with the knowledge graph. As further shown in FIG. 1F, and by reference number <b>180</b>, the information indicating the candidate drugs may be generated in a particular format (e.g., a statements serialization or format) and may indicate that drugs 1-5 are potential candidates as having an effect on SARS Type B.</p><p>As shown in FIG. 1G, and by reference numbers <b>165</b> and <b>180</b>, a prediction engine, of the prediction platform, may receive the revised knowledge graph embeddings (e.g., described above in connection with to FIG. 1E) and the candidate drugs (e.g., described above in connection with FIG. 1F). In some implementations, and as shown by reference number <b>185</b> in FIG. 1G, the prediction engine may score the candidate drugs based on the revised knowledge graph embeddings. In such implementations, the prediction engine may utilize a relational learning model (e.g., TransE, RESCAL, ComplEx, DistMult, HolE, and/or the like) to determine values associated with the candidate statements (e.g., scores). The prediction engine may then utilize the values to calculate the probability estimates for the candidate drugs.</p><p>As further shown in FIG. 1G, and by reference number <b>190</b>, the prediction engine may provide the scored candidate drugs in a particular format. In some implementations, the scored candidate drugs may include the information included in the candidate drugs and may also include the scores for the candidate drugs (e.g., drug 1 has a score of 0.436, drug 2 has a score of 0.532, drug 3 has a score of 0.857, drug 4 has a score of 0.237, and drug 5 has a score of 0.866).</p><p>As further shown in FIG. 1G, and by reference number <b>195</b>, the prediction engine may calculate results for the scored candidate drugs. In some implementations, the prediction engine may utilize a predetermined threshold for a score (e.g., 0.85) to calculate the results, where if a candidate drug has a score that satisfies the predetermined threshold, the prediction engine may output that candidate drug as being a drug that has an effect on SARS Type B. For example, since drugs 2 and 5 have scores greater than the predetermined threshold, the prediction engine may output drugs 2 and 5 as having an effect on SARS Type B. In some implementations, the prediction platform may provide the scored candidate drugs and/or the results to the user device, and the user device may display the scored candidate drugs and/or the results to a user of the user device (e.g., via a user interface).</p><p>In this way, several different stages of the process for predicting links in knowledge graphs are automated, which may remove human subjectivity and waste from the process, and which may improve speed and efficiency of the process and conserve computing resources (e.g., processors, memory, and/or the like). Furthermore, implementations described herein use a rigorous, computerized process to perform tasks or roles that were not previously performed or were previously performed using subjective human intuition or input. These roles may include predicting links in knowledge graphs without having to retrain the knowledge graphs, utilizing the predicted links to answer queries, and/or the like. Finally, automating the process for predicting links in knowledge graphs conserves computing resources (e.g., processors, memory, and/or the like) that would otherwise be wasted in retraining the knowledge graphs.</p><p>As indicated above, FIGS. 1A-1G are provided merely as examples.

For example, the ontology may include nodes that represent concepts related to a disease, and edges or links that show interrelationships between the concepts related to the disease.</p><p>In this way, prediction platform <b>220</b> may receive the training data and the ontology for the training data.</p><p>As further shown in FIG. 4, process <b>400</b> may include generating a knowledge graph based on the training data and the ontology (block <b>420</b>). For example, prediction platform <b>220</b> (e.g., using computing resource <b>224</b>, processor <b>320</b>, and/or the like) may generate a knowledge graph based on the training data and the ontology. In some implementations, the training data and the ontology may be provided to a knowledge graph converter of prediction platform <b>220</b>. In some implementations, the knowledge graph converter may receive the training data and the ontology, and may convert the training data from a format received by prediction platform <b>220</b> into another format. In some implementations, the knowledge graph converter may aggregate the converted training data so that the knowledge graph converter may process the aggregated data.</p><p>In some implementations, the knowledge graph converter may generate a knowledge graph based on the training data and the ontology. In some implementations, the knowledge graph converter may utilize a schema matching technique to align the training data and to integrate the aligned training data into the ontology (e.g., to generate the knowledge graph). The schema matching technique may include determining semantic correspondences between elements of two schemas (e.g., the training data and the ontology). In some implementations, the schema matching technique may analyze and compare the schema to determine correspondences among concepts and to detect possible conflicts. Once the conflicts are detected, the schema matching technique may resolve the conflicts so that merging of the schemas is possible. Once the conflicts are resolved, the schema matching technique may merge the schemas.</p><p>In some implementations, the schema matching technique may include a schema-level matching technique, an instance-level matching technique, a hybrid matching technique, a reusing matching information technique, and/or the like.</p><p>In some implementations, the knowledge graph converter may utilize other techniques to align the training data and to integrate the aligned training data into the ontology (e.g., to generate the knowledge graph), such as machine learning techniques, and/or the like.</p><p>In this way, prediction platform <b>220</b> may generate the knowledge graph based on the training data and the ontology.</p><p>As further shown in FIG. 4, process <b>400</b> may include converting the knowledge graph into knowledge graph embeddings (block <b>430</b>). For example, prediction platform <b>220</b> may convert the knowledge graph into knowledge graph embeddings. In some implementations, a fit/train engine, of prediction platform <b>220</b>, may receive the knowledge graph. In some implementations, the knowledge graph may be serialized into a list of statements, and the list of statements may be received by the fit/train engine. In some implementations, the fit/train engine may generate knowledge graph embeddings based on the knowledge graph. In some implementations, the knowledge graph embeddings may include points in a k-dimensional metric space, and may provide latent semantic representations for structured knowledge in the knowledge graph. In some implementations, the knowledge graph embeddings may enable direct explicit relational inferences among entities via simple calculation of embedding vectors, and may be effective at highlighting key concepts underlying sophisticated human language.</p><p>In some implementations, the fit/train engine may convert entities (e.g., nodes) and relations (e.g., links or edges) of the knowledge graph into points in a k-dimensional metric space. In some implementations, the knowledge graph embeddings may include points in a k-dimensional metric space (e.g., shown as a graph in two dimensions for simplicity). In some implementations, the fit/train engine may utilize a loss function to analyze the knowledge graph, and determine how well the knowledge graph tells positive statements from negative statements.</p><p>In some implementations, the fit/train engine may assign scores to statements of the knowledge graph in order to aid the loss function in determining how well the knowledge graph tells positive statements from negative statements. In some implementations, the fit/train engine may minimize the loss function in order to determine optimal parameters of the knowledge graph (e.g., the knowledge graph embeddings).</p><p>In this way, prediction platform <b>220</b> may convert the knowledge graph into the knowledge graph embeddings.</p><p>As further shown in FIG. 4, process <b>400</b> may include receiving new statements that include a new entity unseen in the knowledge graph (block <b>440</b>). For example, prediction platform <b>220</b> (e.g., using computing resource <b>224</b>, processor <b>320</b>, and/or the like) may receive new statements that include a new entity unseen in the knowledge graph. In some implementations, prediction platform <b>220</b> may receive (e.g., from user device <b>210</b>) new statements (e.g., that includes a new entity) indicating that SARS Type B is a disease. In some implementations, the new statements may include an ontology and a serialized representation of the ontology. In some implementations, the ontology may relate to SARS Type B. In some implementations, the serialized representation of the ontology may indicate the same information as the ontology in a different format.</p><p>In this way, prediction platform <b>220</b> may receive the new statements that include the new entity unseen in the knowledge graph.</p><p>As further shown in FIG. 4, process <b>400</b> may include generating an approximate embedding for the new entity and adding the approximate embedding to the knowledge graph embeddings (block <b>450</b>). For example, prediction platform <b>220</b> (e.g., using computing resource <b>224</b>, processor <b>320</b>, and/or the like) may generate an approximate embedding for the new entity, and may add the approximate embedding to the knowledge graph embeddings. In some implementations, an embedding approximation engine, of prediction platform <b>220</b>, may generate the approximate embedding for the new entity, and may add the approximate embedding to the knowledge graph embeddings (e.g., to generate revised knowledge graph embeddings).</p><p>In some implementations, the embedding approximation engine may approximate an embedding for the new entity based on a weight (e.g., &gt;1), an average number of entities that are in the ontology, are related to the new entity, and are related to a schema (e.g., the knowledge graph), and an average number of entities that are in the ontology, are related to the new entity, and are not related to the schema. In some implementations, the embedding approximation engine may apply more weight to the entities of the ontology that are related to the schema than to the entities of the ontology that are not related to the schema.</p><p>In some implementations, the revised knowledge graph embeddings may include points in the k-dimensional metric space (e.g., shown as a graph in two dimensions for simplicity), and may include a point (e.g., an embedding) calculated for the new entity.</p><p>In this way, prediction platform <b>220</b> may generate the approximate embedding for the new entity, and may add the approximate embedding to the knowledge graph embeddings.</p><p>As further shown in FIG. 4, process <b>400</b> may include receiving a query for information associated with the knowledge graph (block <b>460</b>). For example, prediction platform <b>220</b> (e.g., using computing resource <b>224</b>, processor <b>320</b>, and/or the like) may receive a query for information associated with the knowledge graph. In some implementations, a candidate generation engine, of prediction platform <b>220</b>, may receive a query requesting information about a drug that has an effect on SARS Type B. In some implementations, prediction platform <b>220</b> may receive the query from user device <b>210</b> (e.g., at the request of the user of user device <b>210</b>).</p><p>In this way, prediction platform <b>220</b> may receive the query for the information associated with the knowledge graph.</p><p>As further shown in FIG. 4, process <b>400</b> may include generating candidate responses to the query based on the knowledge graph (block <b>470</b>). For example, prediction platform <b>220</b> (e.g., using computing resource <b>224</b>, processor <b>320</b>, and/or the like) may generate candidate responses to the query based on the knowledge graph. In some implementations, the candidate generation engine may analyze the query based on the knowledge graph to determine drugs that have an effect on SARS. In some implementations, the candidate generation engine may generate information indicating candidate drugs based on the query and based on the analysis with the knowledge graph. In some implementations, information indicating the candidate drugs may be generated in a particular format.</p><p>In this way, prediction platform <b>220</b> may generate the candidate responses to the query based on the knowledge graph.</p><p>As further shown in FIG. 4, process <b>400</b> may include scoring the candidate responses, based on the knowledge graph embeddings, to identify a particular candidate response (block <b>480</b>). For example, prediction platform <b>220</b> (e.g., using computing resource <b>224</b>, processor <b>320</b>, and/or the like) may score the candidate responses, based on the knowledge graph embeddings, to identify a particular candidate response. In some implementations, a prediction engine, of prediction platform <b>220</b>, may receive the revised knowledge graph embeddings and the candidate drugs. In some implementations, the prediction engine may score the candidate drugs based on the revised knowledge graph embeddings. In such implementations, the prediction engine may utilize a relational learning model (e.g., TransE, RESCAL, ComplEx, DistMult, HolE, and/or the like) to determine values associated with the candidate drugs (e.g., distances of the candidate drugs from the point calculated for the new entity in the revised knowledge graph embeddings). The prediction engine may then utilize the values to calculate probability estimates (e.g., scores) for the candidate drugs.</p><p>In some implementations, the prediction engine may provide the scored candidate drugs in a particular format. In some implementations, the scored candidate drugs may include the information included in the candidate drugs and may also include the scores for the candidate drugs.</p><p>In some implementations, the prediction engine may calculate results for the scored candidate drugs. In some implementations, the prediction engine may utilize a predetermined threshold for a score in order to calculate the results, where if a candidate drug has a score that satisfies the predetermined threshold, the prediction engine may output that candidate drug as being a drug that has an effect on SARS Type B. In some implementations, prediction platform <b>220</b> may provide the scored candidate drugs and/or the results to user device <b>210</b>, and user device <b>210</b> may display the scored candidate drugs and/or the results to a user of user device <b>210</b> (e.g., via a user interface).</p><p>In this way, prediction platform <b>220</b> may score the candidate responses, based on the knowledge graph embeddings, to identify the particular candidate response.</p><p>In some implementations, prediction platform <b>220</b> may perform a variety of actions based on the identified candidate response. For example, prediction platform <b>220</b> may automatically order the candidate drugs if there is an uptick in SARS Type B; automatically identify locations where to order the candidate drugs, provide information indicating the locations to user device <b>210</b>, and allow the user of user device <b>210</b> to order the candidate drugs from the locations or request that the candidate drugs be automatically ordered from the locations; automatically identify doctors specializing in the treatment of SARS Type B; automatically make an appointment for the user of user device <b>210</b> with one of the identified doctors; provide information indicating the identified doctors to the user of user device, and allow the user of user device <b>210</b> to make an appointment with one of the identified doctors or request that the appointment be automatically made for the user; and/or the like</p><p>Although FIG. 4 shows example blocks of process <b>400</b>, in some implementations, process <b>400</b> may include additional blocks, fewer blocks, different blocks, or differently arranged blocks than those depicted in FIG. 4. Additionally, or alternatively, two or more of the blocks of process <b>400</b> may be performed in parallel.</p><p>Some implementations described herein provide a prediction platform that predicts links in knowledge graphs using ontological knowledge and without retraining the knowledge graphs. For example, the prediction platform may receive training data and an ontology for the training data, and may generate a knowledge graph based on the training data and the ontology. The prediction platform may convert the knowledge graph into knowledge graph embeddings, and may receive new statements (e.g., new entities) that are not present in the training data and the knowledge graph embeddings. The prediction platform may generate approximate embeddings for each new entity, and may generate revised knowledge graph embeddings that include the new statements. The prediction platform may receive a query for information associated with the knowledge graph, and may generate candidate responses to the query based on the knowledge graph. The prediction platform may score the candidate responses based on the revised knowledge graph embeddings, and may identify a particular candidate response, that best answers the query, based on scoring the candidate responses.</p><p>The foregoing disclosure provides illustration and description, but is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the implementations to the precise form disclosed. Modifications and variations are possible in light of the above disclosure or may be acquired from practice of the implementations.</p><p>As used herein, the term component is intended to be broadly construed as hardware, firmware, or a combination of hardware and software.</p><p>Certain user interfaces have been described herein and/or shown in the figures. A user interface may include a graphical user interface, a non-graphical user interface, a text-based user interface, or the like. A user interface may provide information for display. In some implementations, a user may interact with the information, such as by providing input via an input component of a device that provides the user interface for display. In some implementations, a user interface may be configurable by a device and/or a user (e.g., a user may change the size of the user interface, information provided via the user interface, a position of information provided via the user interface, etc.). Additionally, or alternatively, a user interface may be pre-configured to a standard configuration, a specific configuration based on a type of device on which the user interface is displayed, and/or a set of configurations based on capabilities and/or specifications associated with a device on which the user interface is displayed.</p><p>It will be apparent that systems and/or methods, described herein, may be implemented in different forms of hardware, firmware, or a combination of hardware and software. The actual specialized control hardware or software code used to implement these systems and/or methods is not limiting of the implementations. Thus, the operation and behavior of the systems and/or methods were described herein without reference to specific software code—it being understood that software and hardware may be designed to implement the systems and/or methods based on the description herein.</p><p>Even though particular combinations of features are recited in the claims and/or disclosed in the specification, these combinations are not intended to limit the disclosure of possible implementations. In fact, many of these features may be combined in ways not specifically recited in the claims and/or disclosed in the specification. Although each dependent claim listed below may directly depend on only one claim, the disclosure of possible implementations includes each dependent claim in combination with every other claim in the claim set.</p><p>No element, act, or instruction used herein should be construed as critical or essential unless explicitly described as such.
