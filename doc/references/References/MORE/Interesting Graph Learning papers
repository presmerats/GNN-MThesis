DeepMem: Learning graph neural network models for fast and robust memory forensic analysis
	ACM SIGSAC

	O.S. Kernel data structure detection from raw memory dumps.
	1) list traversal approaches -> DKOM attacks, 2) robust signature-based approaches are not scalable or efficient (entire memory scan), and domain knowledge of the O.S. needed

	DeepMem automatically generates abstract representation for kernel objects
		1) reconstructs tha contents and topology info of a mem dump
		2) gnn architecture to embed the nodes in the memory graph
		3) an obejct detection method that cross-validates the evidence collected from different parts of objects


Deep Program Reidentification: A Graph Neural Network Solution
	
	Attention muulti-channel graph neural network model (DeepRe-ID) to verify the program's identity based on its system behaviors.
	Leverage representation learning of the program behavior graph to guide the reidentification process
