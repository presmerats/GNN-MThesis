	%summarized description of GNN
	Data structured as graphs exists in multiple domains like biochemistry, image processing, recommender systems and social networks analysis to name a few. Several approaches to train machine learning models on graph structured data by using preprocessing techniques exist but they lack the flexibility to completely adapt to the dataset and task at hand. Graph Neural Networks allow to create an end to end machine learning model that is simultaneously trained to learn a representation of graph structured data and to fit a predictive model on it. Graph Neural networks can be applied to tasks that range from clustering or visualization, to classification or regression on graph data. Their can also learn a representation the node or the graph level. They achieved state-of-the-art performance on semi-supervised learning and supervised graph classification. Semi-supervised learning is when a graph contains some labeled nodes and their labels are extended to the rest of the nodes of the graph, for example to classify Reddit posts. Supervised graph classification or regression is applied for predicting the class or the value of some attributes of proteins in biochemistry.
	This work will explore some of the most prominent Graph Neural Network variants and apply them to two tasks: approximation of the community detection Girvan-Newman algorithm and compiled code snippet classification.
