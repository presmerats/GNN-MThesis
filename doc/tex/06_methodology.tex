Methodology...

Building the dataset:
	
Preprocessing of the data:
	- no outliers/missing/errors done, just feature selection


Baseline models
	- simpler models

Cross-validation training
	- cv, folds then retraining
	- class-imbalance handled with
		- balanced training dataset splits
		- useing f1-macro as we want to optimize for overall prec-rec on all classes

Model selection
	using the cv-score (f1-macro)
	then showing the generalization capability of the model on the test set (understand if cv score increases also makes the test score do it)
