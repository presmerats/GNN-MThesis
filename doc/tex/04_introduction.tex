Introduction...
%Introduction (extend abstract)
Quick sumarial definition of graph neural networks (Reference papers).
	what: embedding of the nodes or the graph
	how: 2 basic methods matrix factorization and distance methods
	why: used in node and graph regression/classification. Promiment applications are semi-supervised node classification in big size graphs and graph classification for proteins

Prominent application areas
	social network analysis
	recommender systems
	combinatorial optimization
	biochemistry, molecules/proteins classification
	geometric deep learning: 3d object meshes


% Motivation
	Fact: attention in the scientific comunity <- increase of papers in this area.
	conclusions

% Goals
	test gnn modeling techniques to known and novel problems. chosen novel problems: Girvan_newmann approximation and compiled code function classification

% organisation of the thesis
	SOTA, methodology, implementation, evaluation, conclusion
