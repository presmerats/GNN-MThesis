\section{Conclusion}



reasons why ggnn < tfidf:
* polymorphism, graph structure is not so much related to function result as expected. We know that any func in assembly can be rewritten just with SUB instructions (reference to hacking, the art of exploitation) , because in the end the result is in the data manipulation.
* GPU memory -> GGNN need a lot of memery, O(n^?), and function graphs are bigger than protein graphs
