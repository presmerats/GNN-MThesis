TFM GNN
=======


goals
------

survey, test, benchmark, compare

apply to one domain
	recommneder,  bioinformatics, code analysis, knowledge graphs

publish


steps
-----

1) Read many papers, test and summarize
	-> overview of all variants, their adv. and disadv.
	-> understand the math behind of all of them
	-> know and use their counterparts (kernels, embeddings, etc)
	-> understand how they are build (replicate all?)
	-> benchmarks and datasets that exist
	-> gather all the future works proposed by authors

	-> main actors, their twitter and other account
	-> write state of the art
	-> survey what topics are hot
	-> survey what topics are trendy in each application domain
		- in Bio?
		- in Recommender systems?
		- in Knowledge graphs/logics/reasoning?
		- in code analysis?
		- in Reinforcement learning?

	-> ideas for research
		- ask people also

2) Decide on the goal
	-> theoretical or practical
	-> application domain or in the theoretical plane
	-> publish or not

3) Plan the research
	-> approaches, datasets, experiments, deadlines

4) Research and report
